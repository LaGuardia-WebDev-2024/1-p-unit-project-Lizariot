    <p>
      The West Highland White Terrier (commonly shortened to Westie) is a breed
      of dog from Scotland with a distinctive white harsh coat and somewhat soft
      white undercoat. It is a medium-sized terrier, though with longer legs
      than other Scottish terriers. It has a white double coat of fur which
      fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance.
